"# Mouse-Reveal-Effect

A beautiful interactive mouse reveal effect that creates stunning visual trails as you move your cursor across the screen.

## Features

- **Dynamic Reveal Circles**: Creates animated circles that follow your mouse movement
- **Beautiful Background**: Features a cosmic gradient with twinkling stars
- **Smooth Animations**: Uses CSS animations for smooth scaling, fading, and color transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on any screen size
- **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Demo

Move your mouse around the screen to see the reveal effect in action!

## How It Works

The effect uses JavaScript to track mouse movements and dynamically creates `<span>` elements positioned at the cursor location. Each span is styled with CSS to display a circular reveal with a space-themed background image, animated to shrink and fade out over time.
